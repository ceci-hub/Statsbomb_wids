- createpitch.R contains a function [create_statsbomb_pitch](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/StatsBomb_WomensData/blob/master/2.CreateAPitchForStatsBomb.md). The function in this file has been modified from the original based on this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63398825/building-a-shotmap-in-ggplot2-with-facet-wrap-and-receive-error-width-must-be-o) to allow for facet_wrap to work.
